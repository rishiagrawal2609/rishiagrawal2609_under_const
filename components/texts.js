Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.`;
